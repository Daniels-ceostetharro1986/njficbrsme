Whoa, man, just finished watching iHostage, and I'm shaking my head so hard. Like, first off, WHAT was that plot twist? I mean, c’mon, feels like they just tossed it in there for the heck of it. You know what I mean? One minute I'm all wrapped up in the tension, and boom, they're throwing curveballs. It's like they just wanted to keep us guessing who’s the real villain every 15 minutes, classic move.

And the characters, lol, don’t even get me started. One moment they're acting all smart, making me think they'll save the day, and then BAM, they do something so dumb I can't even. Seriously, it’s like they hit a bumbling button halfway through the movie. Still, it was worth downloading the movie just to see how completely bonkers it got.

Anyway, it’s funny how everyone seems to have mysterious hacking skills now. These guys can just whip out a laptop, tap a few keys, and suddenly they’ve got access to, like, a government database or some such madness. I almost choked on my popcorn at that scene. It's 2023, man, we all know hacking ain't just Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V.

> When your friend recommends it, so you finally sit down to watch the movie, and you're just like, Wait, what reality am I in? 😂 But hey, I gotta admit, the action sequences weren't half bad, gotta give them that. You could see where all the budget went. Explosions were on point, not gonna lie.

Oh! That soundtrack though! Kinda digging the beats they chose. Had that sick suspense vibe, got my heart racing even when, plot-wise, my brain was going, Make it make sense! Lmao. Maybe it was the caffeine kicking in or just the ambiance, but kudos to the sound crew, right?

Anyway, what's your take? I'm here rambling like a nut, but I need someone to verify I'm not the only one scratching my head over this film. 😂 Drop me your thoughts when you can!
